<h1>BORDER COLLIES COME FROM ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND</h1>
<p>A relatively new shepherd and farm dog, the border collie originally developed in the border lands connecting England and Scotland, hence the breed's name. In the 19th century, farmers in the region bred sheepdogs that were the ancestors of modern border collies.</p>

    <h1>BORDER COLLIES ARE CONSIDERED THE BEST HERDING DOG BREED</h1>
<p>Border collies are skilled at a variety of tasks and jobs, but they are sheep herders at heart. Today, border collies are still regularly employed as shepherds, and many often compete in herding competitions. The drive to herd is so innate and so strong in the breed that some border collie owners have been known to rent or buy sheep simply to allow their dogs to indulge the compulsion..</p>
   
    <h1>
BORDER COLLIES ARE ALSO THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL BREEDS
</h1>
<p>In our culture, physical prowess and intelligence are often considered opposing attributes, but in border collies the two are inextricably linked. The border collie is ranked the No. 1 smartest dog breed, and its intelligence demands to be applied to specific tasks. Border collies are always hungry to herd sheep, perform agility courses or even just play fetch. As long as they have "jobs" to stimulate them mentally, border collies are happy..</p>
    
    <h1>BORDER COLLIES HOLD LOTS OF JOBS OTHER THAN HERDING</h1>
<p>
Border collies are born to herd, but their intelligence, drive and eagerness to please means that human often successfully employ border collies in a variety of other capacities. They make excellent therapy dogs, search-and-rescue dogs, and medical-alert dogs for seizures or other medical emergencies.

    <h1>ALL BORDER COLLIES CAN TRACE THEIR LINES BACK TO ONE DOG</h1>
<p>The father of all border collies is Old Hemp, who lived from 1893 to 1901. Old Hemp began herding sheep at 6 weeks old. He displayed not only a preternatural talent for the work, but also a unique style, herding sheep much more quietly and lessly aggressively than other sheepdogs, yet without any loss of effectiveness. His ability and temperament inspired the creation and codification of the border collie breed..</p>

    <h1>ROBERT BURNS OWNED AND WROTE ABOUT BORDER COLLIES</h1>

    <h1>THE AMERICAN KENNEL CLUB FIRST RECOGNIZED THE BORDER COLLIE IN 1995</h1>
<p>The AKC didn't recognize border collies until 1995, but not due to any snobbery on their part. It was the objections of border collie fans themselves that caused the delay. Border collie breeders intend for their dogs to show physical and herding skills above appearance, and there was concern that the dogs' integrity would be compromised following registration with an organization whose standards are intended for show dogs. In recent years, border collie lines are separated into herding dogs and show dogs. Many border collies fans continue to oppose the AKC's recognition of the breed..</p>
    
    <h1>BORDER COLLIES MAKE GOOD ACTORS</h1>
<p>Probably as a result of their intelligence and workaholism, border collies are frequently cast to star in movies and TV shows. One of the most famous example from the 1990s is Maui, a border collie mix who played Murray, the dog owned by the central couple in the sitcom "Mad About You." Maui played Murray for seven seasons, and twice was named TV Guide's most popular dog on television. Other border collies appeared on the "Little House on the Prairie" TV series, and in the movies "Babe" and "Babe: Pig in the City."
